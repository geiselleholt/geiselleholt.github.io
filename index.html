            <blockquote>I'm so grateful to have the opportuity to be at Ada Developer's Academy!
            The instructors are knowledgeable and patient and have a way of making me feel at ease with learning
            the abundance of material that's brand new to me. My fellow students are supportive and encouraging and
            I feel blessed to be going on the same journey with so many wonderful people. The staff at Ada have been
            amazing resources for all of my needs and more. I've learned so much about diversity and social justice
            and I'm passing along that important information to friends and family. I hope this website is a
            testament of what a person can do in very little time if given the learning structure and supportive
            like I'm getting in this AMAZING program. THANK YOU ADA for making me a better person and making the
            world a better place üíù
